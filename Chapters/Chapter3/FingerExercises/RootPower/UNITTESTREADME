HOW TO WRITE TESTS
##################################################

First you must make a few decisions:
    
    1) What do you want to test?
    2) Are you writing a unit test or an integration test? 

Then the structure of the test should follow this workflow: 

    1) Create your inputs   (ARRANGE)   
    2) Execute the code being tested, capturing the output (ACT) 
    3) Compare the expected output with the expected result (ASSERT)

For this application we are going to test sum(). Here's a list of example 
behaviours we could test.

    Can it sum a list of whole numbers (integers)?
    Can it sum a tuple or set?
    Can it sum a list of floats?
    What happens if you pass a bad value like a single integer or a string? 
    What happens when one of the values is negative?
