There are different programming languages which have different properties
* Low Level vs High Level
    Move 64 bits of data from this location to that location.
* General versus Targeted to an Application Domain
    SQL is great for Databases but terrible for creating an operating system
* Interpreted versus Compiled
    Interpreted languages are much easier to debug because the interpreter can
    produce error messages. Compiled lanuages usually produce programs that run
    more quickly and use less space.""")

The goal of this book is to teach the reader how to write programs that solve 
problems (as well as python). Python is a great programming language that can be 
used to pretty much make anything that doesn't require direct access to the 
computers hardware. Python is not great fro programs that require high 
high reliability constraints because of its weak static semantic checking.""")

print("""
(What is static semantic checking?)
A statically typed language is one in which each declared variable's types is 
declared at compile time which is before when the program runs. It illiminates 
a group of bugs which are created as a result of "grammatical" errors in the code. 
Imagine you attempted to do the operation '5' * '6'. This kind of error will be 
found whilst you are programming not during the running of the program. """)

print("""
Though python isn't statically typed it is particularly useful as it is relatively 
simple syntactically and it has a large number of libraries that interface with 
Python which extend its functionailty.""")
